Subject: Request for Application Fee Waiver - Master of Science in Software Engineering Systems (Spring 2024)
Dear Admissions Committee,

I hope this letter finds you well. I am writing to respectfully request a waiver of the application fee for my prospective enrollment in the Master of Science in Software Engineering Systems program at Northeastern University for the Spring 2024 term.

I wish to express my sincere interest in joining the esteemed academic community at Northeastern University. However, I find myself facing significant financial hardship, particularly due to the currency exchange rate between the Nigerian Naira and the U.S. Dollar, which has placed added strain on my financial resources.

As an international applicant from Nigeria, the cost of applying to universities in the United States has become a considerable financial burden for me and my family. The application fee, in conjunction with other related expenses, poses a challenge to my ability to apply to multiple institutions.

I am deeply committed to furthering my education and firmly believe that the Master of Science in Software Engineering Systems program at Northeastern University aligns perfectly with my academic and career goals. I have a strong academic background, as evidenced by my Second Class Upper Division classification in my BSc in Computer Science

I kindly request your consideration of my financial circumstances and my sincere desire to join the Northeastern University community. A waiver of the application fee would significantly alleviate the financial burden and enable me to submit a comprehensive application.

I have not benefited from any college programs that provide financial assistance, and my current financial situation compels me to seek this fee waiver.

Thank you for your time and consideration of my request. I look forward to the possibility of becoming a part of the Northeastern University community and contributing to its academic excellence.

Sincerely,

Oni Michael Samuel
